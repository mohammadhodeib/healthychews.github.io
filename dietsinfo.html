<h2> The Ketogenic Diet </h2>
<div class="content" > 
<div class="imgs"><img src="images\keto.jpg" ></div>
<p> The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. </p>

    <h2> The low fat diet  </h2>
     <div class="content">
        <div class="imgs"><img src="images\lowfat.webp" ></div> 
  <p> A low-fat diet is one that restricts fat, and often saturated fat and cholesterol as well. Low-fat diets are intended to reduce the occurrence of conditions such as heart disease and obesity. </p>

        <h2> Mediterranean Diet </h2>
         <div class="content">
            <div class="imgs"><img src="images/meditterean.jpg" ></div> 
      <p> As the name suggests, the Mediterranean Diet is inspired by the eating habits of people who live near the Mediterranean Sea. Those countries include Greece, Italy, Spain, Lebanon, Turkey, and more. These countries have some of the longest life expectancies in the world. According to a study in the Lancet Medical Journal, Spain’s citizens are expected to live to an average age of 85.8 years. (5) The United States’ life expectancy, for comparison, is about 78.5 years.

        The diet is rich in heart-healthy foods such as vegetables, fish, fruit, grains, olive oil, and nuts. Consumption of red meat is kept to a minimum, and dairy intake is moderate and consists of high-quality sources such as yogurt and cheeses.

            <h2> Carnivore Diet </h2>
             <div class="content">
                <div class="imgs"><img src="images/carnivore.jpg" ></div> 
          <p> What if your mother’s advice to eat your vegetables was a lie? That’s the essence of the carnivore diet, the antithesis of veganism. Carnivore devotees only eat animal-based products — meat, cheese, milk, animal-based fats, and eggs (though some variations only allow meat, no eggs, and dairy). There are no grains, no vegetables, and no fruits. No, that’s not a joke.</p>

                <h2> Paleo Diet </h2>
                 <div class="content">
                    <div class="imgs"><img src="images/caveman.jpg" ></div> 
              <p> The Paleo diet, sometimes called “The Caveman Diet,” could be considered a cousin of the carnivore diet. In addition to meat, you’re also eating fish, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds. You need to avoid any grains, dairy, processed foods, beans, legumes, and sugars while adhering to this diet. </p>
